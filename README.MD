# Danmakufu Player Balancing

This Danmakufu script uses the Danmakufu APM to track metrics including boss health over time. It provides a number of different types of attacks with different boss behaviors.

This script was made for the testing of player scripts with multiple shottypes within the player script. It does NOT provide DPS counts.
